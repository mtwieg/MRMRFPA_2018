Some component footprints are to be left unpopulated.
These components have been ommitted from the BOM and CPL files.
All lines on the BOM and CPL files should be populated.

Labelling of component polarity is as follows:
Diodes have "A" and/or "K" labels for anode and cathode, respectively
ICs with assymetric footprints (SOT23-3, SC70-5, etc) do not have labels, orientation is implicit
ICs with symmetric footprints have "1" labels as pin 1 indicators
eGaN FET packages have dots as pin 1 indicators
Polarized capacitors have "+" labels for positive terminal indicators
SMT connectors have "1" labels as pin 1 indicators
