Submitted for quotation for PCB fabrication and assembly
All documents refer to a single piece
Arrays should have 4-8 pieces per panel

Material: FR4 1/16" finished thickness
Number of layers: 4
All copper layers 1oz
Surface finish: Immersion silver

Board dimensions: 4.25" x 1.7", indicated on silkscreen layers

Soldermask (green) both sides
Silkscreen (white) both sides
Please ignore silkscreen features which extend beyond the board dimensions, and which overlap with soldermask openings.

Layout contains soldermask defined pads. Soldermask artwork depicts desired FINAL feature size, do not modify without my written approval.
eGaN FETs on top side require specific considerations for solder paste.
Top side stencil must be 4mil thick, laser cut. Top side components must use SAC305 Type 3 solder, reference 88.5% metals content.
Do not add any features or artwork to any layers without my written approval.
