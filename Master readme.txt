This set of files was prepared specifically to accompany a MRM manuscript
The files are sufficient to manufacture the Power Board of a the RFPA module as described (with some minor tweaks)
They include:
1. The gerber and excellon files for the PCBs
2. A bill of materials (BOM) for the components
3. A centroid file for component placement
4. Assembly drawings
5. Readme files for PCB stackup and assembly
6. Schematic drawings

We used Advanced Circuits for PCB manufacturing and assembly. Most other fab houses should be able to produce similar results.

Note: These documents only cover assembly of most surface mount components. To get a fully functional module, you will need the following:
1. The control board. We have not year prepared this design for mass manufacturing.
2. The hand-made toroidal chokes (L201, L112, L113)
3. The coaxial connectors (X109, J1, J2)
4. The impedance transformers on the input and the output of the CMCD stage
5. Resistors on solder jumpers SJ302 and SJ303 (See schematics)
